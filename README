very simple!, no complexity needed!

********************************************************************************
Compiling
********************************************************************************
Flatboot uses autotools as the main build system generator because it's very based

In order to generate the configuration scripts you only need to run:
"autoreconf"

Use "./configure --host=s390-linux --target=s390-linux" in order to configure
for a MVS-compatible target.

You'll need make, hercules and dasd-utils (they come with hercules by default).

In order to compile the bootloader just do:
"./compile.sh"

To build a "test" system use:
"./test.sh"
